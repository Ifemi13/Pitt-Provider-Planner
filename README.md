## Inspiration
We were inspired to build a scheduling program because of the difficulty faced when trying to schedule an appointment from a students point of view. 

## What it does
It takes in a doctor and their schedule and compares it to a student and their schedule and times the times that do not conflict.

## How we built it
We built the program to scrape raw data from a .txt file and fill in entries in our datasheet for both our doctor and student classes. Next, we found and converted local fields into comparable variables and compared to get our result.

## Challenges we ran into
We ran into challenges getting the program to run using HTML and javascript, but then switched to java halfway through because of the difficulty of expanding on the original concept in HTML and javascript. 
We also ran into challenges when collaborating on the project with vscode liveshare being a bit messy with how the shared code was susceptible to being buggy with different people on the same document.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We were proud to come together to work on different topics to properly communicate and address the challenges that came up during coding.

## What we learned
We learned the importance of having a team with experience, diverse perspectives, and the importance of delegation and teamwork

## What's next for Pitt Provider Planner
The plan to expand our program is to add more functionality to the program like a daily routine planner, integrating a quick transfer option to quickly add your classes to your schedule, and integration with health statistics to analyses sleep and other bio metrics.
